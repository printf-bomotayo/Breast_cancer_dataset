# Breast_cancer_dataset
This REPO contains the source code for the various classification algorithms using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set as a case study. The objective of this REPO is to demonstrate the process of model selection based on the accuracy rank of each of the considered models.
Below are the models under consideration:
  > Decision_Tree algorithm;
  > KNN algorithm;
  > Kernel SVM algorithm;
  > Logistic regression algorithm;
  > Naive_Bayes algorithm;
  > Random_forest algorithm;
  > Support_vector_machine algorithm
